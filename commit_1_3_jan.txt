The base file to the directory of the models is now not hardcoded anymore. The
individual path of every user of todesstern-raytracer is stored in a property
file (ATM you have to create it) you find a manual in the comments of the class.
TODO Later on in the GUI mode this will happen when a new user registers to the
ray tracer. This means when the user wants to add images or models he can pick,
add and delete them in the GUI per drag & drop. The same is implemented for the
texture from file.

Started to implement the Test Scene from task BELEUCHTUNG 2 ABBILDUNG 5.
Yesterday i had still some issues with the reflectiveMaterial, locks not bad but
the shadows on the spheres locking not directly like in the scene from the task.

Implemented texture,simpleColorTexture,imageTexture from File (not tested yet)..
have done major changes to all geometries..the mapping is hardwired in the
geometry classes not nice, but will work for the start.TODO// Later on it's
better so write this into an mapping structure..

changed some comments and  cleared some code..
